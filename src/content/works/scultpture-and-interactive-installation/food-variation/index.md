An interactive installation that reflects a current reality where sweet and sour sexual pleasure exists as an open offer hanging along our way of social progression.

The audience is encouraged to taste the yogurt melts snack attached to the paperboards; To be, or not to be. How do you want it to be; all up to ourselves.
