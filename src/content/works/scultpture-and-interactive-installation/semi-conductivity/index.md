Semiconductivity is an interactive installation prototype by Wen Wen and John K. Lucy.

They created a fuild boundary responding to the presence of people. A series of ultrasonic sensors detect human motion and feed in motors to deform a wall of plastic stripes.

The material references shanty towns and temporary beddings made by the homeless that protect themselves from rain. The installation aims to promote awareness of the housing crisis in London and the prevalence of rough sleepers.
