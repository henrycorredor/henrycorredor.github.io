Body Sequencer aims to facilitate people coping with stress and emotional shock by engaging with an instrument that translates the rhythm of heartbeats into flowing sound. It allows partakers to observe oneâ€™s physiological status via externalized data - subtle vibrations that affect the mental state of the user and the interaction environment recursively.
