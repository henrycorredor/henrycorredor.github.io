description: A personal story of setting up a Tailscale DERP server in China, learning about ICP registrations, and building a stable Tailnet behind the firewall.

Last month I had a curious experience: learning how to register web services in China. It wasnâ€™t a formal course, just the inevitable result of trying to set up my own personal cloud. Along the way, I discovered two very specific things:

1. The official registrations (ICP and cybersecurity) required for any online service in China.

2. How to set up Tailscale DERP servers inside the countryâ€”something you almost never need outside of China.

Today I wonâ€™t go into detail about those topics. Instead, Iâ€™d rather tell the story that led me there.

## Why get into this mess?

When I lived abroad, Dropbox or Google Drive worked perfectly for me. But here in China, those services are blocked, and the local alternatives come with plenty of downsides: tiny free tiers, no real folder sync, and aggressive business practices.

I tried Baidu Cloud, the market leader, but for foreigners itâ€™s a nightmare: full-speed downloads for five minutes, then a crawl. That frustration pushed me to explore DIY options.

## Raspberry Pi, baby, and Tailscale

At first I considered a NAS: easy, powerful, but way too expensive for my needs. Then I tried a Raspberry Pi with external storage, but quickly ran into the problem of exposing services to the internet from China. Everything popular is blocked, and the local options werenâ€™t appealing. My Pi ended up gathering dust in a drawer.

Around that time my daughter was born, so tech projects moved to the back burner. Months later I discovered Tailscale, and suddenly everything clicked: I could use my home server as if it were part of a local network, without much hassle. It felt like finding the missing piece of a puzzle.

The only catch: Tailscaleâ€™s global DERP servers donâ€™t work well from inside China. Connections get unstable and slow after crossing the firewall.

## The need for a local DERP

Thatâ€™s when I realized: to have a decent Tailnet in China, I needed to run my own DERP server inside the country. Aliyun has datacenters in Chengdu, so I jumped in.

But nothing here is instant. Before spinning up a VPS, you need to complete the official registrations. Without them, your server stays mute. That process turned out to be the real challenge. Once I cleared it, my local DERP server ran beautifully.

## Whatâ€™s nextâ€¦

The story has a happy ending: now my Tailnet is stable, and I learned a lot in the process. In the coming days Iâ€™ll publish two more posts: one about how the registrations work, and another with a hands-on tutorial for installing a DERP server in China.

For now, this was the story that got me here. And honestly, that alone made it worth writing.
