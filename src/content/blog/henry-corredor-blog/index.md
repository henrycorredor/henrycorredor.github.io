I was born in the mid-80s. We’re the generation that has lived consciously both with and without the internet. And I’ve been active online since the very beginning. I’ve written a couple of blogs on different platforms, and like most people, I’ve posted regularly on social media.

Still, as someone who builds things for the web, it almost felt embarrassing not to have my own space to share what I do. Especially because, in my work as a developer, I’ve come across things that are worth sharing.

Also, I’m curious about everything. I’ve been needing a space to experiment and store my experiences. Along the way, I’ve found things that I think you might find interesting too. And hey, even if not, storing stuff is free :p

And so, that's why Kurilabs is here. This is the first version of the blog, and I truly hope you enjoy it!
